While at CMU I taught three different courses:
* Mathematical methods for Chemical Engineers (06-262). A course for sophomore undergraduate chemical engineering students. 
  * [Course github repo (notes)](https://github.com/ulissigroup/math-methods-chemical-engineering)
  * [Course website](https://ulissigroup.cheme.cmu.edu/math-methods-chemical-engineering/intro.html)
* Numerical Methods and Machine Learning for Chemical Engineers (06-325). I developed and taught a new required junior-level mini course for chemical engineering undergraduates.
  * [Course github repo (notes)](https://github.com/ulissigroup/F22-06-325)
  * [Course website](https://ulissigroup.cheme.cmu.edu/F22-06-325/intro.html)
* Chemical and Reactive Systems (06-625). I taught a graduate course on reaction engineering and numerical methods for MS-level chemical engineers.
